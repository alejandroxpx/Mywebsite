# Mywebsite
Personal website about myself and my experience. 
This website is still a work in progress.

For recruiters, 

My name is Alejandro Pasillas.
I am a mechanical engineer at heart but enthusiastic about creative design and innovation. 
I love to code but am still learning web programming in python and javascript as well as artificial intelligence with python.
I am mission driven but also love helping people. The best way to combine both is to create technology that brings joy and inspiration to many.
Please reach out to me if you have any questions about my experience.
Thank you!
