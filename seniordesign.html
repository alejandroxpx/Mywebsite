        <h1>Senior Design - Thermal Managment of High Powered Electronic Device</h1>
        <img class = "qorvo" src="./Images/UTDesign_Qorvo.jpg" alt="UTDesign & Qorvo">
        <p>Radio frequency (RF) devices in the Aerospace and Defense fields utilize 
            high-powered circuitry for broadband communications and radar sensing. 
            Qorvo specializes in these devices, but seeks a method of cooling the 
            electronics without dissipating heat to the environment. 
            Qorvo tasks Team Unphased to create a thermal management solution for 
            a circuit of two monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) that 
            dissipate 75 W and 10 W in ten minutes. The team utilizes phase change 
            material (PCM) to absorb the bulk of the heat from the high-flux MMICs. 
            PCMs can absorb high amounts of energy during their phase change process. 
            PCMs have the adverse property of low conductivity; a suitable heat 
            sink is designed to conduct heat from two small square MMIC surface 
            areas of 0.19 in^2 into the PCM.</p>

         <h1>My Role</h1>
         <p>In my final semester as a senior, I asked my senior design team If I could lead the team. 
             My goal was to end this semester with a successful project and success in my mind meant leading the team
             through the major milestones, delivering a project that exceeded our clients expectations, and presenting 
             a design and product at our design competition that would exemplify our efforts. 
         </p>
         <h4> Our Team placed 2nd place in the mechanical engineering category!</h4>
         <p> Collectively, the team worked over 1,100 hours over the course of 2 semesters. 
             We worked through a pandemic, and fought through many setbacks. I learned about the importance of communications
             and the power of team work. My main contribution was utilizing SolidWorks and working with the machine shop to fabricate our components. Furthermore, I ran transient thermal simulations on ANSYS Workbench and 
             verified results through physical testing in a laboratory environment.
             I also managed the team through major milestones, arranged meetings with client and technical manager, and upheld professionalism at all time through 
             correspondense with all shareholders.
        </p>
        <h4> We presented to staff, students, and family members, and were invited to present to engineers at Qorvo as well!</h4>
